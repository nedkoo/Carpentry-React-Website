# Carpentry-React-Website

Open source website for viewing carpentry arts, toys and furniture. This website is being built as my JS Web project in ReactJS Module, Software Engineering, Software University.This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Development
To fix a bug or enhance an existing module, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b exciting-stuff`)
3. Make the appropriate changes in the files
4. Add changes to reflect the changes made
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'exciting-stuff!!'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin exciting-stuff`)
7. Create a Pull Request


### Interested?
If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave irrelevant results), kindly open an issue [here](https://github.com/nedkoo/carpentry-react-website/issues/new) by including your search query and the expected result.

If you'd like to request a new functionality, feel free to do so by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/nedkoo/carpentry-react-website/issues/new). Don't forget to include some sample queries and their corresponding results.


### What next?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
